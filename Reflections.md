#### Week 2 Presentation 

This week's presentation preparation allowed Matt, Kara and I to get a better understanding of the full scope of our project. Not only were we able to create a list of requirements, but we also split up the project into three parts, which allowed me to get a better understanding of what I will be working on this semester. 

Here are some of the things that I worked on this week and some skills I found myself working :

1. Project planning:
At the beginning of this week, we only had an idea of what we wanted to do and had Professor Skon's website as a reference. Although we were given a general outline of features that Skon wanted to have, we were given the freedom to decide how we want to go about each part of the project and what to include. This definitely helped me with my project planning skills. Sometimes it is overwhelming to be given a problem and to decide what specific steps to take in order to solve it. This week definitely improved my skills in this area. A specific example of this is when the three of us met to discuss the requirements we wanted for this project and what elements we need in order to achieve this. We were able to make a document to share with Skon and get his feedback.

2. Teamwork:
Working as a group is something that I wasnt anticipating, but it ended up working really well with our backgrounds. We had multiple meetings with Skon and divided the work in a way that will still require some collaboration. Although the collaboration was something that I was not as interested in, just in case one portion of the project needs to wait on another, but so far we have been in close contact with eachother through the planning stage. This will help me in the long run since most software jobs require teamwork. A specific example is when we met with Skon to review our requirements document and discussed our individual roles and how they will interact with eachother. 

3. Presentation skills:
Although I find myself fairly confident and calm when giving presentations, giving technical presentations is something that I have only done recently. This week was a group presentation which took about 45 minutes. I want to work toward being extremely comfortable giving presentations on the technical background that my portion of the project will need, and I think that this past week was a step in the right direction. I feel like my comfortability was shown in, not only my sections of the presenation, but in how I was able to answer most of the questions that our class asked. 

4. Moving forward: 
I think that a big skill that I want to work on during this semester-long project is self-motivation when it isn't my week to present. This past week, I found myself extremely motivated, but I am curious if most of that was due to our long presentation. My hope is to continue working hard each week and keep my work load relatively even each week. I set up weekly meetings with Professor Skon to assure that I stay on task.

#### Week 6 Presentation 

This week's presentation came shortly after making multiple unfortunate discoveries about my progress. I first figured out that I cannot use Tableau if I want to have a live connection with the data. I also found out that much of Professor Skon's code, which I thought I could recycle and just change minimally, needs to be completely rewritten. Although this is a setback, it allowed me to outline my next steps with Professor Skon, which I think will put me right back on track. 

Although technically this was a setback and much of my work that I have done so far won't be applicable to our final product, there are many skills that I worked on in the recent weeks that will be helpful moving forward. 

1. Experience in data visualization software:
Although I won't be able to use Tableau for this project, I did a lot of work with that specific software and figured out what type of visualizations I want. This will help me in many ways moving forward.

2. Overcoming Issues
As you can see, I am at a part in my project where I have to take a different path than I was previously anticipating. Although it was definitely a bummer at first, I think it will put me in a much better position moving forward in that I can focus now on connectivity that I will need regardless. With this, there is no way that I will get the same kind of set back that I just experienced. 

3. Moving Forward
My mindset needs to change a little bit from figuring out the data visualizations to understanding and setting up the code behind fetching the data when a user requests some data. Once I complete this, I will be able to use a data visualization tool (Highcharts?) in order to connect the data to the website's html pages.

#### Week 8 Presentation

Although there wasn't a lot to show in terms of progress in this presenation, I felt like I made significant strides since my last presentation. I was nervous that my setback would cause a lot more problems than it did, but in the past few weeks, I was able to plan figure out how I will be able to complete this project with the allotted time. After figuring out how to connect my JavaScript files with the data from the C++ file, this allowed me to complete two major data visualizations for my project. Moving forward, I need to complete the additional data visualizations, get them working with Kara's C++ code and fill in the extra informational pages on the website. 

Through the past few weeks, I did gain a lot of skills in the process, especially when trying to recover from the setback. 

1. Communication with Group
Although this still needs to be improved greatly, in the past few weeks I connected more with my group members and integrated some of their work into my own. This is definitely a step that made me feel more solidified in what I was doing. Since we are coming to the point where our individual work needs to be knit together, the upcoming weeks will need to include more meetings and interaction between us all. 

2. HighCharts code manipulations
One thing that I am proud of from the past few weeks is that I feel very confident in my ability to alter the HighCharts demos into something that is helpful for me to use. I feel like this allowed me to regain my confidence in this project, which was decreased a little after my troubles with Tableau. 

3. Time management
After the past few weeks, it has become very obvious that the amount of work that I put into this project needs to be more steady. I found myself taking some weeks off and working a great amount other weeks, which made some weeks more stressful than they needed to be. From this point on, I have made it a plan to complete certain sections each week to keep myself accountable. 

4. Moving forward 
I need to make sure that I keep motivated in my project so that I don't fall behind at the end of the semester. I have found that I enjoy this project more when I don't feel a major time crunch.
