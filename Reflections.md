# Reflection 1 
#### Week 2 Presentation 

This week's presentation preparation allowed Matt, Kara and I to get a better understanding of the full scope of our project. Not only were we able to create a list of requirements, but we also split up the project into three parts, which allowed me to get a better understanding of what I will be working on this semester. 

Here are some of the things that I worked on this week and some skills I found myself working :

1. Project planning:
At the beginning of this week, we only had an idea of what we wanted to do and had Professor Skon's website as a reference. Although we were given a general outline of features that Skon wanted to have, we were given the freedom to decide how we want to go about each part of the project and what to include. This definitely helped me with my project planning skills. Sometimes it is overwhelming to be given a problem and to decide what specific steps to take in order to solve it. This week definitely improved my skills in this area. A specific example of this is when the three of us met to discuss the requirements we wanted for this project and what elements we need in order to achieve this. We were able to make a document to share with Skon and get his feedback.

2. Teamwork:
Working as a group is something that I wasnt anticipating, but it ended up working really well with our backgrounds. We had multiple meetings with Skon and divided the work in a way that will still require some collaboration. Although the collaboration was something that I was not as interested in, just in case one portion of the project needs to wait on another, but so far we have been in close contact with eachother through the planning stage. This will help me in the long run since most software jobs require teamwork. A specific example is when we met with Skon to review our requirements document and discussed our individual roles and how they will interact with eachother. 

3. Presentation skills:
Although I find myself fairly confident and calm when giving presentations, giving technical presentations is something that I have only done recently. This week was a group presentation which took about 45 minutes. I want to work toward being extremely comfortable giving presentations on the technical background that my portion of the project will need, and I think that this past week was a step in the right direction. I feel like my comfortability was shown in, not only my sections of the presenation, but in how I was able to answer most of the questions that our class asked. 

4. Moving forward: 
I think that a big skill that I want to work on during this semester-long project is self-motivation when it isn't my week to present. This past week, I found myself extremely motivated, but I am curious if most of that was due to our long presentation. My hope is to continue working hard each week and keep my work load relatively even each week. I set up weekly meetings with Professor Skon to assure that I stay on task.
