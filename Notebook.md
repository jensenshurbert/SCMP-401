# Week 1 Notebook
### 1/29/18-2/4/18
#### Advisor: Jim Skon
Spoke with Jim Skon about the Belize Solar Panel data he has been collecting with the goal of creating a better website for data visualization. Decided to collaborate with Kara Braun and Matt Carney on the project. Below is some research and tenative plans for the course of the project.

##### Requirements: 
* Analysis - summary, cost, power output, efficiency
* Time Scales - now, day, week, month, long-term, YTD, seasonal
* Site/location based data
* Visualizations - map, data
* Background - Belize Solar Project, location, climate, pictures
* User Interface - refresh to same page, update home page
* Performance - database sub-tabling, minimize clicking

##### Background:
###### Solar Energy:
* Traditional energy resources are becoming less viable
* Energy from the sun is converted into thermal or electrical energy
* Solar is clean and abundant
* Panels are typically placed on roofs or in direct line with sunlight 
###### Belize:
* Eastern Coast of Central America
* Tropical climate - two seasons (hot and dry)
* Avg. temperature 84 degrees F
###### Belize Solar Project:
* Jim Skon and group of Kenyon Students
* Volunteer to install solar panels on primary schools in the area
  * Schools gained access to new computer labs so they need more power
* Grid-tie Solar Power Systems
###### Current Website Research
* Show refresh of summary page
  * very slow, graphs not labeled, comparing data from different times with different scales
* Specific site
  * Static page with no interactive visualizations, real-time data not really in real time, generally, more information can be gathered by adding or changing the current visualizations
* Graphs - only shows data from one day
##### Our plan
###### Overview
Create/upgrade a website that analyses the data in an efficient way. Our website will allow user interaction with the data and provide clear and informative data visualizations.
###### Data Retrival and Management
* As of right now, this will be Kara's component
###### Data Analysis
* Matt's section
###### Data Visualizations
* I will be the lead person for this section of the project
* Goal - display the findings of our analyses in a clear and interactive way
* What makes good visualizations
  * Clear context that is measured against clear goals
  * Simple and digestible
  * Choose the right visual for the purpose
  * Keep users engaged
* Types of visualizations
  * Line charts
  * Bar charts
  * Scatter plots 
  * Bubble charts 
  * Pie charts
  * Etc.
* Connect visualizations with locations on map
* Tableau Software
  * Data visualization tool that allows you to input your own data
  * Can be used to compare your data based on different constraints
  * Interactive element with the users 
  
#### Up Next
This next week, we will finalize the list of project requirements and meet with Jim Skon to get time estimates for each section of the project in order to divide the work. This will allow us to begin our individual components of the project. I also plan to talk to Skon about Tableau to make sure it will be appropriate for his dataset.
